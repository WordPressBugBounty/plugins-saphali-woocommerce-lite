A set of additions to the WooCommerce online store.
Adds localization & special tools in WooCommerce.

== Description ==

WooCommerce Lite!
Functional additions for WooCommerce - specifically for managing fields on the checkout page.

= Integrates into the store: =
* Ability to customize the order form for checkout
* Manage the number of columns in the catalog

= Features =
* From WooCommerce version 8.3, fields are used as blocks by default (i.e., fields are configured as if editing the Checkout page itself). The plugin has been tested for compatibility with Checkout Blocks from WooCommerce 8.5.0 and above. If you have a lower version and the functionality in the block checkout does not work, to use the capabilities of this plugin, <strong>you just need to switch to Classic Shortcode</strong> when editing the <em>Checkout</em> page. If necessary, you can always convert back to blocks.
* Added to the general list of currencies — Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH), Russian Ruble (RUB), Belarusian Ruble (BYN), Armenian Dram (AMD), Kyrgyz Som (KGS), Kazakhstani Tenge (KZT), Uzbekistani Som (UZS), Lithuanian Litas (LTL)
* Manage fields on the checkout page and profile page. The function allows you to customize the order form for checkout. You can make some fields optional at checkout or remove them completely, thereby simplifying the checkout process. You can also add your own special fields.
* Manage the number of columns in the product catalog (Shop) and categories.
* The plugin is designed to simplify the development of online stores.
* The plugin does not change the original WooCommerce files, you can update the WooCommerce plugin every time new versions are released!
* Mapping fields to payment and shipping methods, e.g., it will be useful if some fields do not need to be displayed when paying with a certain shipping and/or payment method, but are needed with another shipping or payment method.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the contents of the zip file into your site's plugins folder (wp-content/plugins/), using your favorite FTP program.
2. Activate the plugin on the "Plugins" page in the admin panel.
3. All installation is complete.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Error "Please enter an address to continue" =
In case of an error (in WC > 3.4) "<em>Please enter an address to continue</em>", check if the <strong>billing_country</strong> field is deleted or disabled. If there is shipping, without a location, WC does not allow placing an order. Shipping zones work by determining the country first (depending on the settings, geolocation, or store address), if this is not possible because there is no corresponding field, this notification is displayed.

== Screenshots ==
